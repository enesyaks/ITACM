## 💡 Why ITACM?

Most asset trackers are either a spreadsheet that rots or a heavyweight SaaS you can't self-host. ITACM sits in the middle:

- **One command to run.** `docker compose up -d` gives you the database, schema, first admin and a full web UI — no build step, no separate frontend to deploy.
- **Handovers that hold up.** Every asset assignment is an atomic, row-locked transaction that produces a printable **Zimmet Tutanağı** (handover receipt) with your company branding.
- **The whole company, one dump.** Assets, employees, receipts, contracts and audit history live in PostgreSQL. Uploaded document files live on the filesystem (`DATA_DIR/documents`); use `npm run migrate:export` for a full move.
- **Works from the warehouse floor.** The UI is fully responsive with a mobile bottom-nav and a camera QR/barcode scanner — count stock or hand over a laptop from your phone.
- **Yours to keep.** No telemetry, no vendor lock-in, MIT licensed.

## ✨ Feature highlights

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🖥 Built-in, mobile-ready web UI
Served by the backend itself — no build step, strict same-origin CSP. 16 modules, global search (Cmd/Ctrl+K), QR codes, dark-mode aware, and a responsive shell with mobile bottom-nav + camera scanner. Just open `http://localhost:8000`.

### 🤝 Atomic handover basket
Assign multiple assets to an employee in one all-or-nothing transaction, producing a printable handover receipt (Zimmet Tutanağı). Row locks make double-assignment impossible; reprints preserve the original issuer's name.

### 🎨 Customizable handover designs
Live-preview editor to pick which sections, columns, titles and labels appear on the printed/PDF form, plus multiple visual themes (`terminal`, `classic`, `corporate`, `slate`).

### 🌐 Network & Server inventory
Infrastructure gear (switches, firewalls, routers, servers, storage) kept **out** of personal zimmet — assigned to a **site + responsible person** instead. Interactive **dependency topology** (per-site graphs, uplinks, cross-site parents) and **rack-cabinet** U-maps.

### 🏢 Providers & Contracts
Vendors / ISPs / MSPs as first-class records with contacts, account numbers and support lines. Attach **contracts** with renewal dates, cost, billing cycle and internal owner; 60-day renewal alerts and per-provider document storage.

### 📱 Mobile lines
Company SIM cards & phone numbers as first-class inventory: operator, plan, ICCID, monthly cost. Assign / take back with full history — lines show up on the employee profile and on handover forms.

### 🧑‍💼 Guided onboarding & offboarding
Schedule a new hire's kit (reserve assets + lines), then complete it into a single handover. Offboarding is a **transactional checklist** that returns, reassigns, scraps or sells every asset, seat, line and infra responsibility before deactivating the employee.

### 🌳 Organization chart
Departments (with a **manager**), teams (with a **lead**) and their members drawn as an interactive **topology graph** — the same node-and-edge style as the network view. Assign or change a manager/lead in one click, add teams, and move people between them. Departments are a **single source of truth**: add one in the Product Catalog and it shows up here instantly, ready for a manager. Great for helpdesk escalation — one glance shows who to contact.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔐 Role-based access control
`Owner`, `Admin`, `Helpdesk`, `Viewer` roles enforced on **every** endpoint, re-checked on each request so changes apply instantly. Owners can disable or delete accounts — every disable/enable/delete/role change is recorded. Sign-in is local email/password with **TOTP MFA** — optional for every role and **mandatory for `Owner` accounts**: an Owner must enrol MFA before using the app, cannot disable it, and no one can be promoted to Owner until they have it enabled. Plus password change and server-side logout (JWT revoke). There is no SSO / Entra login.

### 🧾 System-wide audit log
A unified, filterable timeline of **all** instance activity — assets, users, documents, handovers, logins, settings and more — merging the append-only audit table with legacy domain history. Search by source, actor and date; secrets are redacted before storage.

### ⏳ Product lifecycle (EOL)
EOL windows resolve in three tiers — **per-asset override → per-catalog-model → per-category default**. Set a category default in Settings, give a specific catalog model its own lifecycle (e.g. **Apple MacBooks at 5 years** while other laptops keep 4), or override a single device — or untick EOL for a category (accessories) to exclude it entirely. Every asset shows its EOL date and "EOL soon" / overdue flags.

### 📦 Physical stock counts
Open a count session and scan from **any signed-in device** — start on the PC, keep scanning barcodes/QRs from your phone camera. Closing the session reconciles against live inventory: found / missing / unknown, with CSV export.

### 📥 Excel / CSV migration
Download the template, fill it with your existing zimmet spreadsheet, upload — a dry-run preview shows exactly what will be created, then one transaction auto-creates employees, catalog entries, assets (sequential tags) and one handover per employee with full history.

### 📄 Licenses · 🏷 labels · 💱 currency
Seat pools with atomic claim/release and 30-day expiry alerts. Print scannable **Code 128** labels (size/fields/copies configurable). Pick your **display currency** for costs across the app.

### 🌍 Multi-language UI
12 languages (EN, TR, DE, FR, ES, IT, PT, NL, PL, RU, AR, JA). Pick one on the onboarding screen, change it any time in Settings; untranslated strings fall back to English.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> 🚀 **First-run onboarding** sets your company name, logo and Owner account; branding flows into the UI and every printed receipt.
> 🧪 **Demo dataset** (~100 employees by default) — seed **inside** the API container:
> `docker compose exec api npm run seed:all -- --reset` (demo + infra + providers). Scale with `SEED_EMPLOYEES=200`. Password for demo IT/Portal users: `Demo123!`.

---

## 📱 Mobile ready

The entire app is responsive — no separate mobile build:

- Collapsible sidebar with a **bottom navigation bar** and a center **QR-scan** button.
- **Camera** barcode/QR scanning (via a vendored ZXing build) for stock counts and quick asset lookup.
- **Start on PC, continue on phone**: open a stock-count session on your desktop and keep scanning from any signed-in device.
- Viewport-fit, theme-color and web-app meta so it behaves well when added to a home screen.

---

## 🧰 Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Node.js ≥ 20, Express 4 |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 — idempotent `schema.sql` + tracked versioned migrations, applied on startup |
| **Auth** | JWT (HS256, pinned alg) + bcrypt (cost 12), role-based middleware re-checked per request |
| **Frontend** | Vanilla JS SPA served by the backend — **no build step**, split into per-view modules |
| **PDF / labels** | PDFKit + QR codes, custom handover templates, Code 128 barcodes |
| **Scanning** | Vendored ZXing browser build (camera QR/barcode) |
| **Packaging** | Docker + Docker Compose |

---

## 🚀 Quick start — Docker Compose

Everything is automatic: the database container is created, the schema + migrations are applied, and the first Admin (Owner) account is seeded.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/itacm.git
cd itacm

npm install
npm run setup          # generates .env with strong secrets (or copy .env.example)

docker compose up -d
docker compose logs api   # first-run Owner credentials are printed here
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** — the first visit asks **New workspace** (product tour + company/Owner setup) or **Migrate from another server**.

> [!TIP]
> If you leave `ADMIN_PASSWORD` empty, a strong random password is generated and printed **once** in the API logs. Change it after first login.

Prefer to configure by hand? Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set at least `JWT_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`), then `docker compose up -d`.

---

## 🌍 Deploying to a server

The compose file works unchanged on any host with Docker. Put a reverse proxy (Caddy / Nginx / Traefik) with TLS in front of port 8000 and set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your frontend's origin if it differs.

For managed platforms (Railway, Render, Fly.io, Cloud Run…), deploy the `Dockerfile`, attach a Postgres add-on, and set the same environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `PGSSL=true`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_*`). The schema and migrations are applied automatically on startup.

---

## 💾 Backup & recovery

PostgreSQL holds assets, employees, receipts, contracts, settings (SMTP, company, zimmet templates) and audit history. **Uploaded document files** live under the `app-data` volume (`DATA_DIR/documents`), not only in the database.

```bash
npm run backup                 # → backups/itacm-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql.gz  (DB only)
npm run restore backups/itacm-20260707-120000.sql.gz   # replaces current DB (asks to confirm)

# Full system move (DB + documents) — also available in the UI:
npm run migrate:export         # → migrations/itacm-migrate-… (+ .zip if available)
npm run migrate:import path/to/itacm-migrate-… [--yes]
```

First open of a fresh install offers **New workspace** or **Migrate from another server**. Copy `JWT_SECRET` from the source `.env` to the target (required for SMTP password decrypt). Owner can also export from **Integrations → System migration**.

Copy the `backups/` / `migrations/` folders somewhere safe, or schedule DB backups with cron, e.g. daily at 02:00:

```cron
0 2 * * *  cd /path/to/ITACM && npm run backup
```

### Changing the database password

`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is fixed when the database volume is first created. **Editing it in `.env` and restarting will not work** — the API will fail to authenticate. To rotate it safely, without losing any data:

```bash
npm run change-db-password
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Never run `docker compose down -v`.** The `-v` flag deletes the database volume and permanently destroys all your data. If the API ever reports `password authentication failed`, run `npm run change-db-password` (or restore the previous password in `.env`) — do not wipe the volume.

## ⚙️ Configuration reference

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| `PORT` / `API_PORT` | – | HTTP port (default `8000`) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | – | Comma-separated allowed origins (blank = same-origin) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db` (or `POSTGRES_URL`) |
| `PGSSL` | – | `true` for managed Postgres over TLS |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅ | Min 32 chars — `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | – | Token lifetime (default `12h`) |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | – | First-run Owner seed (password auto-generated if empty) |

With docker compose, `POSTGRES_DB` / `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` feed both the database container and the API's `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## 🔌 API reference

All responses are `{ success, data }` or `{ success: false, error, details? }`. All endpoints (except `login` / `health`) require `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>`. Every router applies `authenticate`; writes/deletes additionally require a role.

<details>
<summary><b>The atomic handover basket — how it works</b></summary>

<br />

```http
POST /api/handovers
{
  "employeeId": "…",
  "documentType": "single",
  "items": [
    { "assetId": "…", "conditionNote": "New, sealed box" },
    { "assetId": "…", "conditionNote": "Used, good condition" }
  ]
}
```

In **one transaction** (Postgres `BEGIN … FOR UPDATE`): every asset is validated as `In Stock` → the receipt document is created → each asset flips to `Assigned` bound to the employee → the employee's `activeAssetCount` is incremented → one audit row is written per asset.

If **any** asset is locked, the API returns `409` with a per-asset conflict list and **nothing is written**. Row locks / transaction retries make it impossible for two operators to hand over the same laptop concurrently.

</details>

## 🔒 Security notes

- **Secrets never live in the repo.** `.env` is git-ignored; the setup wizard writes it with `0600` permissions and generates a strong `JWT_SECRET` and DB password for you. Database backups (`backups/`) are git-ignored too.
- **Auth:** passwords are bcrypt-hashed (cost 12); JWTs are signed HS256 with the algorithm **pinned** on verify; login uses a single error message and a constant-time compare (dummy hash for unknown emails) so it can't be used to enumerate accounts; every request re-checks the user row so role changes / disables / deletes apply instantly; **`Owner` accounts must have TOTP MFA enabled** — until they do, the middleware blocks every route except MFA enrolment, token verification and logout.
- **Access control:** every API router mounts `authenticate`, and mutating routes add `requireRole(...)`. The audit log **redacts** sensitive keys (passwords, tokens, keys) before persisting.
- **Uploads:** document routes validate the real file type by **magic bytes** (not the client's claim) and cap the body at 12 MB; downloads set a sanitized `Content-Disposition`. All SQL is parameterized; all rendered values are HTML-escaped.
- **Hardening:** strict Content-Security-Policy (no inline scripts, self-only), HSTS, nosniff / frame-deny / referrer / permissions-policy headers, login rate-limiting (20 / 15 min / IP), global API rate limit (1000 / 5 min / IP), same-origin-only CORS by default, 1 MB default body limit, `x-powered-by` disabled, a one-shot onboarding endpoint that locks itself after first use, and an `npm audit`-clean dependency tree.
- **Transport:** front the API with HTTPS (Caddy / Nginx / Traefik). Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your exact frontend origin if it differs.
